### üóìÔ∏è Day 1 ‚Äì 30th July 2025  
The first day of the induction program at GNDEC began with a peaceful kirtan at the Gurudwara, followed by snacks and a warm gathering. Around 11 AM, the formal program started with inspiring speeches by our respected Principal, **Dr. Shejpal Singh**, and the Chief Guest, **Sardar Maheshinder Pal Singh Grewal** (Ex-Cabinet Minister). The HoD of Applied Sciences also delivered a motivating address. However, the anchoring lacked energy and clarity, slightly affecting the flow. Post-lunch, I explored the campus ‚Äî the vintage architecture blended with greenery gave it a refreshing vibe. Later, we visited our departments where **JP Sir** welcomed us with enthusiasm. The tour of the workshops made me even more excited for the journey ahead.

### üóìÔ∏è Day 2 ‚Äì 1st August 2025  
The second day of the induction program was filled with meaningful sessions and new experiences. We began with an expert lecture by **Dr. Priya Darshni Madam** on *Universal Human Values* in the main auditorium, which was both interactive and thought-provoking. This was followed by an inspiring session from **Dr. Arvind Dhingra**, Director of STEP and TAC in-charge, who shared valuable insights that left a lasting impact. After a short break from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM, I took the opportunity to explore my department further, which helped me feel more connected to my academic space. The day concluded with English and Maths proficiency tests. The questions were fairly easy, and with a little help from my fellow classmates, I was able to complete them smoothly.

### üóìÔ∏è Day 3 ‚Äì 4th August 2025  
After the weekend break, the third day of the induction program began with a spiritually uplifting and motivating start, as always, led by our HoD, **Dr. Harpreet Kaur**. The positive energy she brings every morning truly sets the tone for the day. The first session featured a presentation by members of the **Causmic Club**, which was particularly eye-catching. A special mention goes to **Taranpreet Kaur**, our senior from the IT department and the convenor of CSMC, whose confident and inspiring talk left a strong impression on me ‚Äî I‚Äôm genuinely considering joining the club in the future. Following that, **Dr. Randhir Singh** introduced us to the college culture and the examination code of conduct. Post that, we had a second insightful session on *Universal Human Values* by **Dr. Priya Darshani Madam**. After the lunch break, we attended an engaging and informative lecture by **Prof. Jaswant Singh Taur** in the Mechanical Seminar Hall, which wrapped up the day on a very positive and interactive note.

### üóìÔ∏è Day 4 ‚Äì 5th August 2025  
The fourth day of the induction program brought some unexpected frustration. The schedule for the day was shared quite late at night, which created confusion for many students. Initially, we were informed that sessions would begin post-lunch at 1:30 PM. However, just 30 minutes before the scheduled time, a cancellation message was sent out. By then, I was already halfway to college, so I had to return home. To add to the confusion, shortly after reaching back, a new message was circulated stating that **P2P (Peer-to-Peer) classes** would take place instead. Unfortunately, I had already missed the opportunity to attend. While such miscommunications can happen, I hope future updates are more timely and clear to avoid such 
experiences again.

### üóìÔ∏è Day 5 ‚Äì 6th August 2025  
Day 5 began once again with the spiritual and motivating vibes brought by **Dr. Harpreet Kaur**, setting a positive tone for the day. Our first session was led by **Dr. Parminder Singh**, Dean of Student Welfare, who introduced us to the various college resources, anti-ragging policies, and scholarship opportunities available to students. This was followed by an energetic and interactive lecture on *Fitness for Engineers* by **Mr. Manpreet Singh**, the sarpanch of Manakwal village and a professional gym trainer and coach. Later, the **NCC cadets** gave a brief introduction to their unit and activities. One of the highlights of the day was an inspiring expert lecture by **Brigadier P.S. Cheema**, whose words and presence left a lasting impact. After lunch, we proceeded for **ID card formation**, which turned out to be a smooth and light-hearted experience, filled with laughter and good moments with friends ‚Äî a great way to wrap up the day.

### üóìÔ∏è Day 6 ‚Äî 7 August 2025
Day 6 was another great day!  
I started my college at 9:30 AM with a **peer-to-peer lecture by our seniors on C++**, which turned out to be quite helpful.  
I also made some new friends, and we had a lot of fun together. After that, we had an **English lecture** for Mechanical Engineers.  
After the lecture, we had a break till 1:30 PM. The break was quite enjoyable ‚Äî I explored the college again, discovered new places, and even visited the boys‚Äô hostel and girls‚Äô hostel areas.  
Post-break, we had a class in the **Auditorium** with **Dr. Lakhvir Singh Khanna**, the in-charge of CML (Centre of Multi-Faceted Learning). It was a highly interactive session filled with excitement and clapping.  
I even had a personal interaction with him, which was very interesting. He told us about the **CML club**, which sounds very appealing. Now I‚Äôm considering joining either the Cosmic Club or the CML club.  
Most importantly, he introduced us to the **NPTEL** and **Swayam** portals, where we can enrol in free IIT lectures and even earn credits towards a **B.Tech Honours** degree. That was quite fascinating.  
Later, we had an **NSS** session with **Dr. Jasvir Singh**. It was interactive, but not really my area of interest.  
I ended my college day at 3:30 PM feeling satisfied and energized.

### üóìÔ∏è Day 7 ‚Äî 8 August 2025

Today was quite an average day overall. I got my schedule late at night around 12 o‚Äôclock midnight. Classes started at 11:00 AM with **Engineering Drawing**, which was quite interesting and useful for me.  
After that, we had a break, spent having a lot of fun with friends and enjoying the vibes at the canteen.  
Post-break, we had a **Mathematics** lecture where we solved one or two questions. It was more of an introduction for 1st-year B.Tech students, common across all branches, and included a brief overview of the books we would be using.  
Finally, we had an **Economics** lecture in the seminar hall, wrapping up the day by 3:00 PM.
