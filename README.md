### üóìÔ∏è Day 1 ‚Äì 30th July 2025  
The first day of the induction program at GNDEC began with a peaceful kirtan at the Gurudwara, followed by snacks and a warm gathering. Around 11 AM, the formal program started with inspiring speeches by our respected Principal, **Dr. Shejpal Singh**, and the Chief Guest, **Sardar Maheshinder Pal Singh Grewal** (Ex-Cabinet Minister). The HoD of Applied Sciences also delivered a motivating address. However, the anchoring lacked energy and clarity, slightly affecting the flow. Post-lunch, I explored the campus ‚Äî the vintage architecture blended with greenery gave it a refreshing vibe. Later, we visited our departments where **JP Sir** welcomed us with enthusiasm. The tour of the workshops made me even more excited for the journey ahead.

### üóìÔ∏è Day 2 ‚Äì 1st August 2025  
The second day of the induction program was filled with meaningful sessions and new experiences. We began with an expert lecture by **Dr. Priya Darshni Madam** on *Universal Human Values* in the main auditorium, which was both interactive and thought-provoking. This was followed by an inspiring session from **Dr. Arvind Dhingra**, Director of STEP and TAC in-charge, who shared valuable insights that left a lasting impact. After a short break from 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM, I took the opportunity to explore my department further, which helped me feel more connected to my academic space. The day concluded with English and Maths proficiency tests. The questions were fairly easy, and with a little help from my fellow classmates, I was able to complete them smoothly.
